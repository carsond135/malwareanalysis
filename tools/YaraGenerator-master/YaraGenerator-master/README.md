### Information
This is a project to build a tool to attempt to allow for quick, simple, and effective yara rule creation to isolate malware families and other malicious objects of interest. This is an experiment and thus far I've had pretty good success with it. It is a work in progress and I welcome forks and feedback!

To utilize this you must find a few files from a malware family, or if not executables then containing the attribute of interest, you wish to profile, (the more the better, three to four samples seems to be effective for malware, however to isolate exploits in carrier documents it often takes many more). Please note however that this tool will only be as precise as you are in choosing what you are looking for... visit http://yaragenerator.com for a webapplication version of this tool. 

### Version and Updates
0.6.1 - Added logic for parsing and prioritizing strings/emails/headers from emails (must submit in .eml file in order for python library to parse it properly). Added per filetype string prioritization logic (IE include all email addresses and IP's common across emails before random words from email bodys). Due to targeted parsing, effective signatures can be built from a single email. Also boolean logic for email rules is "all of them" to allow for future variance in delivery methods.

0.6 - Refactored all of the code to allow for selectable filetype of samples (-f). This allows for entirely different signature generation for PDFs vs EXEs vs EMails. In addition to dispirate execution paths, each filetype has it's own string blacklist and regexlist to exclude unwanted things such as your gateway, usernames, @yourco.com etc. (Note: No custom per file code exists for anything beyond executables at this point, but the framework is now there)

0.5 - Added Regexes in modules/regexblacklist.txt which will remove matches from potential strings included in yara rules also added 30K strings to blacklist. Lowered hit requirment from 100 to 95% to allow more true positives from slight variants (example change of embeded C2 or UA)

0.4 - Added PEfile (http://code.google.com/p/pefile/) to extract and remove imports and functions from yara rules, added blacklist.txt to remove unwanted strings

0.3 - Added support for Tags, Unicode Wide Strings (Automatically Adds "wide" tag)

0.2 - Updated CLI and error handeling, removed hidden files, and ignored subdirectories

0.1 - Released, supports regular string extraction

### ToDo
[+] Allow for scanning of benign/baseline files to automatically populate blacklists for various filetypes

[+] Create custom execution paths leveraging opensource tools for various filetypes (IE email/pdf/office docs ..etc)

[+] Continue to improve fidelity and flexibility of algos and underlying methodologies to generate signatures


### Example

Usage is as follows with an example of a basic search +  hitting all of
the switches below:
```

usage: yaraGenerator.py [-h] -r RULENAME -f FILETYPE [-a AUTHOR] [-d DESCRIPTION] [-t TAGS] InputDirectory 

YaraGenerator

positional arguments:
  InputDirectory        Path To Files To Create Yara Rule From

optional arguments:
  -h , --help             show this help message and exit
  -r , --RuleName         Enter A Rule/Alert Name (No Spaces + Must Start with Letter)
  -a , --Author           Enter Author Name
  -d , --Description      Provide a useful description of the Yara Rule
  -t , --Tags             Apply Tags to Yara Rule For Easy Reference (AlphaNumeric)
  -v , --Verbose          Print Finished Rule To Standard Out
  -f , --FileType         Select Sample Set FileType choices are: unknown, exe,
                          pdf, email, office, js-html
```

The blacklist.txt file in the /modules directory allows entry of one string per line, these strings will never appear in a rule generated by YaraGenerator.

The regexblacklist.txt in the /modules directory allows entry of one Regular Expression per line. * Remember to use ^ and $ for the begining and end of a string if you wish to match exactly* YaraGenerator will disqualify any string which hits on any regex in the list from input into a Yara Rule.

Example for a Specific Family of APT1 Malware:

```
python yaraGenerator.py ../greencat/ -r Win_Trojan_APT1_GreenCat -a "Chris Clark" -d "APT Trojan Comment Panda" -t "APT" -f "exe"
